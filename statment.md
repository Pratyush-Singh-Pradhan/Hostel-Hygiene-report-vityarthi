# Project Statement

The Hostel Hygiene Report System was made to give students a straightforward way to report hygiene issues 
in their hostel. Most of the time, complaints get passed around verbally or written casually, which makes it 
very easy for things to be ignored or forgotten.

This program keeps things simple: a student submits a complaint through a menu, and the details are saved 
in a JSON file. Someone from the hostel administration can later open the same program and choose the 
admin option to read all the complaints that were submitted.

The goal isn't to create something overly complex, but to ensure that hostel hygiene concerns are recorded 
properly and can be checked whenever needed.
